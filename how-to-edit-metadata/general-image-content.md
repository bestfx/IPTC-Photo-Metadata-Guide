General Image Content
 

A key use of metadata is to describe the content of an image. This can be done in two basic ways:

•Using standard terms from value lists or controlled vocabularies.
Choosing terms from a standard list of values enables easier and more consistent search within a single collection or across collections. Controlled vocabularies are one form of value list.

•Using free-text (natural language)

Keyword

Enter keywords to describe the visible and abstract content of the photograph.  Keywords are in free text form, and may be single or compound terms.
Keywords are descriptive words added to an image to enable search and retrieval. They describe what is visible in the image and concepts associated with the image. Keywords are expressed as a list of terms. Keywords can be single or compound terms.

Values from the controlled vocabulary IPTC Subject Codes should be placed into the “Subject Code” field.

BE AWARE: Keywords may have to be separated by commas or other separators depending on the software. The field for each keyword is limited by the IIM format to about 64 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

 

IPTC Subject Code

This field can be used to specify and categorise the content of a photograph by using one or more subjects as listed in the IPTC “Subject NewsCodes” taxonomy (available from http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/subjectcode). Each subject term is represented as a code of 8 digits in an unordered list. Only subjects from this controlled vocabulary should be used in this field, free text keywords should be entered into the Keyword field.

 

CV-Term About the Image

This field structure is a generic way to add one or more terms, themes or named entities to describe the image.

Multiple terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary. Terms may be from different Controlled Vocabularies.

This CV field enables users to enter terms about the image from specific controlled vocabularies. Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered. The structure is:

•CV Term Name
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary

•CV Term ID
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.

•CV ID
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).

•Refined “About”
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the ‘about’ relationship between the image and the CV term. Example: the concept could stand for emotions shown by persons in the image.

 

Intellectual Genre

Globally unique identifier for controlled terms to describe the genre of the photo. The IPTC Genre vocabulary may be used http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/genre or other genre vocabularies more focused on photography.

 

Genre (generic)

This field structure is a generic way to describe the genre of the photo with a value from any Controlled Vocabulary. (The Intellectual Genre actively supports only the use of an IPTC vocabulary.)

Multiple genre terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary.

Genre Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered. The structure is:

•CV Term Name
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary

•CV Term ID
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.

•CV ID
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).

•Refined “About”
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the kind of genre CV this term originates from. Example: the used genre CV is providing terms of journalistic genres, product genres, usage genres, etc.

 

IPTC Scene Code

This field is used to describe the scene of a photo using one or more terms from the IPTC "Scene-NewsCodes". You should only enter values from the IPTC Scene controlled vocabulary (available from http://www.newscodes.org and http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene). Each IPTC Scene term is represented as a 6 digit numerical string in an unordered list.

Image Rating

Many professional photo applications have had a image rating feature for some time. These are typically shown as star ratings within a collection and are used to indicate the quality of an image; typically giving one star for entry-level photos, and reserving the higher numbered values for more special or unique images. Assigning a star rating as part of a workflow will make it easier to quickly find, sort, or filter out more valuable images from a grouping at a later point in time.

Photographers may use a method where any ‘keepers’ from an assignment are given one star during an initial review. On a second pass they may give a two-star rating to those images deemed superior, or even three stars for those that are outstanding. These values may differ from what an agency or distributor uses, so they may be overwritten or re-evaluated. Some editors recommend that you think of this as a pyramid, with a 10 to 1 ratio between each level. This method will ensure you won’t end up with too many ‘special’ photos in a collection.

To make sure you consistently apply the same image rating criteria each time, write down your rationale. Then put this text somewhere you can refer to each time you are editing.

Here is one photographer's image rating rationale as an example:

-    0 stars = record shots, or don't delete immediately (fall back images)

-    * = Entry level threshold achieved (in focus, exposure within reason)

-    ** = Best shot from each scenario or take. (usually 1 or 2 selected for every 10 shots?)

-    *** = Stars of the collection, have or will prep to master files or client selects

-    **** = Show stoppers. These are the "Best in class" or, "cream of the crop"

-    ***** = Reserved for future use... (which means it could be used for temporary tagging)

Note that the star rating is done by the user/supplier and there is no universal standard for the rating between systems/collections.

 

Natural Language Free Text Descriptions

Free-text descriptions provide valuable information about the image in human readable form.

Headline

A headline is a brief synopsis or summary of the contents of the photograph. Like a news story, the Headline should grab attention, and telegraph the content of the image to the audience. Headlines need to be succinct. Leave the supporting narrative for the Description field. Do not, however, confuse the Headline term with the Title term.

 BE AWARE: this field is limited by the IIM format to about 256 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

 

Description/Caption

The Description field, often referred to as a ‘caption’ is used to describe the who, what (and possibly where and when) and why of what is happening in the photograph. It can include people’s names, their role in the action, the location. Geographic location details should also be entered in the Location fields. The amount of detail included will depend on the image and whether the image is documentary or conceptual. Typically, editorial images come with complete caption text, while advertising images may not.

 BE AWARE: this field is limited by the IIM format to about 2000 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.
