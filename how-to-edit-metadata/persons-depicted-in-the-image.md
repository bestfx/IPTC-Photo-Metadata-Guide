## Persons Depicted in the Image
For a specific person shown in the image several properties can be used:
* Person shown in the image only – use the field Person Shown
* If the name, an identifier and a detailed description of the person is to be entered then the field structure Person Shown with Details should be used.

Persons in the image may also be entered in the caption and keyword fields.

There are other fields associated with persons depicted in the image:
* Additional model info
* Model Age
* Minor model age disclosure
* Model Release Status
* Model Release Identifiers

### Person Shown in the Image
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).

### Person Shown in the Image, with Details
Use this field structure to record details about each relevant and recognisable person(s) shown in the image. This might include links to a global online resource which lists the person uniquely with an identifier.  There are fields to record physical characteristics and other details to help distinguish this person from others in the image.

These details are useful for identifying and distinguishing this person from others in the image.

* **Name**\
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically, these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).
* **Identifier**\
Use this field to enter one or more Globally Unique Identifier(s) for the person, such as those from WikiData or Freebase. This should be entered in the form of a URI.
* **Characteristics**\
Use this field structure including CV Term Name, CV Term ID, CV ID and Refined ‘About’ for properties or traits of the person by selecting a term from a Controlled Vocabulary (CV).
* **Description**\
A free-text description of any actions taken, as well as any gestures or emotional expressions shown, by the person shown in the image.

### Additional Model Information
The Additional Model Information field can be used to record information about the ethnicity and other facets of the person(s) (“model(s)”) appearing in the image. Use the Model Age field to note the age of model(s).

### Model Age
Age of the human model(s) at the time this image was taken in a model released image. If there is more than one model in the image, the ages can be listed in any order.

The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.

### Minor Model Age Disclosure

Age of the youngest model pictured in the image, at the time that the image was made.

The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.

### Model Release Status
This field summarises the availability and scope of model releases authorising usage of the likenesses of persons appearing in the photograph. There are four possible values:
* None (no release is available),
* Not Applicable (there are no recognisable people in the image),
* Unlimited Model Releases (releases are available for all people in the image, AND the terms of each release authorise unlimited usage of the model(s) likenesses)
* Limited or Incomplete Model Releases (there are releases for some of the people in the image, OR one or more of the releases include terms limiting usage of model(s) likenesses).

We recommend that the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Model Releases (MR-UMR) be used sparingly, and encourage you to check the wording of the model release thoroughly before choosing this value.

### Model Release Identifier(s)
Use this field for the ID of each available Model Release document. Be sure to give a unique number or name to all releases (both model and property), and record that information in this field. If you don’t already include an ID name/number on your releases, consider adding one as this will make it easier to cross reference.
